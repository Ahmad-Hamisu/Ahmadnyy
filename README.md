👋 Hi there, I'm Ahmad Hamisu, a Full Stack Developer with a passion for crafting innovative and user-friendly web applications. I possess a diverse skill set that covers both frontend and backend technologies, enabling me to handle all aspects of web development seamlessly.

💻 On the frontend, I am well-versed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I have extensive experience working with popular frontend frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.js. I can create responsive and interactive user interfaces that provide an exceptional user experience.

🔧 As for the backend, I have expertise in server-side languages like Node.js, Python, or Ruby, along with experience using frameworks like Express, Flask, or Ruby on Rails. I can build robust APIs and handle data storage and manipulation efficiently.

🌐 Additionally, I have a good understanding of databases, both SQL and NoSQL, and can work with technologies like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Firebase.

📚 Furthermore, I am constantly expanding my knowledge by exploring modern tools like TypeScript and GraphQL, which allow me to build more scalable and maintainable applications.

💼 In my previous role as a Full Stack Developer at Bloomberg LP, I successfully collaborated with cross-functional teams, seamlessly integrating frontend and backend components to deliver cutting-edge web solutions. I have experience in optimizing application performance, ensuring security, and maintaining high code quality through testing and code reviews.
